# Welcome to colors.scssstudio! 👋

At colors.scssstudio, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern tech stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with physics simulator for browser, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

* **[karma.conf.js](https://github.com/colors.scssstudio/karma.conf.js)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast karma.conf.js library. ✨

Beyond karma.conf.js, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas:

* logging optimization
* http_nmap_validator integration
* Developer experience tools
* Performance monitoring

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline development.
